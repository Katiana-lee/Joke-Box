## Programming-Chistes

A desktop and mobile friendly app that will provid a specific sense of humor, which probably could be understood only by true programmers. The app will provide a set of ten jokes thats intended to bring a smile after a long day of coding. 

## API and Data Sample

The API I am using is from [official_joke_api](https://github.com/15Dkatz/official_joke_api.) which will provide randomized programmer jokes.
```JSON
[
    {
        "id": 27,
        "type": "programming",
        "setup": "['hip', 'hip']",
        "punchline": "(hip hip array)"
    }
]

### MVP/PostMVP

The functionality will then be divided into two separate lists: MPV and PostMVP.  Carefully decided what is placed into your MVP as the client will expect this functionality to be implemented upon project completion.  

#### MVP 

#### MVP 
- Recieve data endpoints
- Imbedding images 
- Using flexbox and CSS to create more authenticity of how the data will be rendered on the page
- Allow user to save their favorite quotes

#### PostMVP  
- Responsive background
- Add animation to make the app fun/engaging 
- Imbed background music
